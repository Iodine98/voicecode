    p Numbers are interpreted in a chain. So if you say: "two one", it understands "21", or "three oh two nine" => "3029". This applies for repeatable commands as well. So be careful not to say: "junk three fifty", when you actually want to just delete three characters then insert "50". "junk three fifty" == "DELETE x350"
