    h1 Dragon Sync
    p.lead After each VoiceCode update, and whenever you add your own commands or enable/disable built-in commands, come here and run these synchronization scripts.

      p This feature depends on fairly intricate applescript communication with Dragon Dictate. Sometimes things don't work for no apparent reason, however it is always simply a matter of trying it a few times.
      p 
        | Usually the issue is with the commands in other scopes besides "Global", because Dragon's applescript API only recognizes those scopes when the actual application corresponding to the scope is activated
        |  - that is the reason for all the application switching going on when it is checking for the command statuses.
      p Things to do if the buttons below are not working:
      ul
        li Make sure dragon is in "command mode" rather than "dictation mode"
        li For each of the contexts besides "Global" make sure the corresponding application is already running
        li Open Dragon's "Show Available Commands" window
        li Restart Dragon Dictate
    a.btn.btn-primary#run Run Command Check
